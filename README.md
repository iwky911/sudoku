# How efficiently can we solve a sudoku ?

It depends on the solver!

This repository contains two method to solve sudokus

* a bruteforce solver, simple but not efficient
* an exact cover solver using [dancing links][dl]

[dl]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links

As the dancing link implementation is pretty fast, we can
use some randomness and quick validity testing to generate
sudokus :)

## Building

```
$ mkdir -p src/github.com/iwky911
$ export GOPATH=$(pwd)
$ cd src/github.com/iwky911
$ git clone https://github.com/iwky911/sudoku.git
$ cd sudoku
$ go build fastsolver.go
$ go build generator.go
```

## Usage
You can pass the sudoku to be solved in a csv format.
Empty or non-integer cells will be considered blank.

For example, using the provided example:
```
$ ./fastsolver -csv=testdata/largeinput.csv
Parsed a matrix of size 16
Sparse matrix created
Affecting, (0, 0) = 0
Affecting, (0, 1) = 1
Affecting, (0, 2) = 2
Affecting, (2, 10) = 2
Affecting, (2, 11) = 4
Affecting, (3, 5) = 5
Affecting, (3, 7) = 1
Affecting, (3, 10) = 0
sudoku is solvable!!

6,16,5,11,14,3,9,13,12,2,10,1,4,7,8,15
```

You can also generate new sudokus with generator with generator.go.
Both the size and the percentage of cell erased is ajustable

Example:
```
$ ./generator -n=36
